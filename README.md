# Tic-tac-toe Game

This repository contains a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-tac-toe game in C++.

## Game Description

The game is designed for 2 players taking turns to mark their symbol ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The players aim to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game.

## Gameplay

The program renders a simple text-based interface for players to interact with the game. Players input a number from 1 to 9 corresponding to the grid positions to place their symbol.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

## Instructions

- Players alternate turns by selecting an empty position on the grid.
- The game ends when either player achieves a winning pattern or the grid is filled, resulting in a draw.

## Code Description

The provided code features a basic implementation of the Tic-tac-toe game using a 2D array to represent the game board. It includes functions to display the game board, handle player turns, check for a win/draw condition, and display the game outcome.

## Usage
